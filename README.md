Summary:

        For my Selenium WebDriver program I have divided the functionality into two sections.
    The first being on the left pane for the scraping of all of the CS courses given a year,
    semester, and result limit. After the search is complete the browser window will close
    and a Save button will appear, allowing you to save the current search results.
        The second is the right/middle pane where a course is entered into the textbox
    (either upper or lower case) and the course description will appear in the textbox
    after the Search button is clicked.
