Summary:

        For my Selenium WebDriver program I have divided the functionality into two sections.
    The first being on the left pane for the scraping of all of the CS courses given a year,
    semester, and result limit. After the search is complete the browser window will close
    and a Save button will appear, allowing you to save the current search results.
        The second is the right/middle pane where a course is entered into the textbox
    (either upper or lower case) and the course description will appear in the textbox
    after the Search button is clicked.
        Additionally, I spoke with professor De St Germain about gathering the course
    description for the CS courses of a given year and semester. Instead of going to the
    course catalog page for each CS course I click on the 'Class Details' button and get
    the description there. He said that this is an acceptable alternative to what he
    initially expected.
